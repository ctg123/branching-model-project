# branching-model-project
This project demonstrates a git branching model that can help a team of developers understand the Git Feature Branch Workflow for faster and efficient integration of work towards project milestone.


The following tools are used:

- **Git**  To connect and push/pull files from the local system to Github which will host the branching model.
- **Linux OS (Ubuntu)** - As the base Operating System to start and execute the project. I am using an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine hosted on my local machine via Vagrant.
